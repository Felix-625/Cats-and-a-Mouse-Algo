# Cats-and-a-Mouse-Algo

This C# program solves the "Cat and Mouse" problem by determining which of two cats (Cat A at position `x` and Cat B at position `y`) will reach a mouse at position `z` first. It calculates the absolute distance of each cat from the mouse and compares them. If Cat A is closer, it returns `"Cat A"`; if Cat B is closer, it returns `"Cat B"`; and if both cats are equally distant, it returns `"Mouse C"` because the mouse escapes. The program reads multiple test cases from input and processes each one in a loop. Results are written to a specified output stream.
